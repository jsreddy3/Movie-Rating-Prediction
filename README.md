## Heart-Diagnosis

# This project predicts the presence of heart disease using 10+ different factors and tests numerous machine learning alogirthms to do so.

## What You Need to Get Started
- The code was designed to run easily and quickly. You can access it [here](https://github.com/jsreddy3/Heart-Diagnosis/blob/master/heart.R).
- The libraries required are included and importable at the top. All libraries you need for the code were placed at the beginning for easy reproducibility.
- The dataset is also loadable through the UCI Machine Learning Repository [website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data), but I have included the steps to load the dataset in code already.
- You will need RStudio. You can find some installation instructions [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

## Quick Notes
- The RMD file also included in this repository is a full summary that was submitted and graded by the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate team.
